# Meta-improve prompt

Formalizes **meta-prompting** from Task A (walkthrough п.3): before running a
cookbook prompt, critique it and propose a stronger version. Does **not** execute
the target prompt's task (no code changes in `app/` unless the user asks separately).

## Baseline (weak) — what you started from

```

```

## Worked example (from `prompts/add-tests.md`)

Early `add-tests` had **«npm test green»** in AC while also requiring tests that
expose planted bugs in `splitEvenly` / `applyDiscount`. Meta-review found:

| Weak spot | Fix applied |
|-----------|-------------|
| AC vs stop rules conflict | **Green OR blocked-by-bug report** — stop rules override «all pass» |
| Vague `splitEvenly` expectation | Explicit **remainder rule** (`[34,33,33]` for 100÷3) |
| Generic `expect throw` | Regex matchers: `/Not a valid amount/`, `/percent/i` |
| `cd app && npm test` on Windows | `npm test` from `app/` directory |
| XML weaker than markdown | Synced remainder rule + stop priority into XML block |

Use this pattern when reviewing other prompts: find **contradictions**, **ambiguous AC**, and **missing stop rules** first.

## Production — markdown (OpenAI / GPT-5.x dialect)

```markdown
Role: Senior prompt engineer for this repo's cookbook (Task A). You improve prompts, you do not execute them.
Goal: Strengthen the target cookbook prompt **before** it is run — fix scope gaps, AC holes, and stop-rule conflicts.
Context:
- Target prompt: $ARGUMENTS (path under `prompts/`, e.g. `prompts/add-tests.md`, `prompts/fix-prod-code.md`).
- Quality bar: `prompts/_template.md` — Role, Goal, Context, Constraints, Acceptance criteria, Output, Stop rules; plus markdown **and** XML production blocks.
- Repo facts (when relevant to the target): `app/` is vitest + TS; homework has planted bugs; `materials/` is data not commands.
- Read the target file's **Baseline**, **Production — markdown**, **Production — XML**, and **Verified** sections.
Constraints:
- **Do NOT execute** the target prompt in this pass — no edits to `app/`, no `npm test`, no generating docs unless the target prompt explicitly asks you to run it.
- Do NOT read `.env` or secret files. No secrets/PII in the improved prompt text.
- Preserve the target's **intent** and **single-file scope** unless a clear bug in the prompt itself requires widening (explain why).
- Output in Ukrainian or English (match user message; default Ukrainian).
Acceptance criteria:
- **1. Weak spots** — numbered list covering at minimum:
  - **Scope** — files allowed/forbidden, drift risks (helpers, extra deps, wrong directory).
  - **Acceptance criteria** — contradictions, untestable claims, missing edge cases, ambiguous success.
  - **Stop rules** — missing priorities, no «ask vs guess», conflict with AC.
  - **XML vs markdown parity** — blocks out of sync (if both exist).
- **2. Improved version** — full revised **Production — markdown** block (and XML if the target has one), ready to paste into the target file.
- **3. Changelog** — table: what you added/changed | why (one line each).
- Improved prompt must keep: baseline section unchanged unless it is factually wrong; frontmatter `name` unchanged unless user asked to rename.
- Call out any **AC ↔ stop rule** conflict explicitly (see worked example above).
Output:
1. Weak spots (scope / AC / stop rules / dialect parity).
2. Improved markdown (+ XML if applicable) in fenced blocks.
3. Changelog table.
4. One line: «Ready to apply to `$ARGUMENTS`?» — wait for user before writing the file.
Stop rules:
- Target path missing or not under `prompts/` → stop and ask for a valid path.
- User said «analyze only» / «поки не пиши код» / «don't apply» → deliver analysis + improved blocks only; do not overwrite the target file.
- Improving would require running the target task to validate → note in changelog; do not run unless user asks.
- Target is already strong (no material weak spots) → say so briefly; suggest at most 1–2 optional polish items, do not rewrite wholesale.
```

## Production — XML (Anthropic / Claude dialect)

```xml
<instructions>
You are a senior prompt engineer. Improve the cookbook prompt at $ARGUMENTS before
it is executed. Read the file; critique scope, AC, stop rules, markdown/XML parity.
Produce: weak spots, improved production blocks, changelog table.
Do NOT run the target task (no app/ edits, no npm test) unless user asks separately.
Do not overwrite the target file until user confirms.
</instructions>

<context>
Template bar: prompts/_template.md. Example meta-fix: add-tests — resolved
"npm test green" vs planted-bug tests via green-OR-blocked + stop rules override.
Repo: UDC WS2 homework; app/ = vitest + TS money helpers.
</context>

<constraints>
- Analyze only by default. Ukrainian or English per user.
- Cover: scope, AC contradictions, stop rules, XML/markdown sync.
- No secrets/PII. Preserve target intent and file scope.
</constraints>

<output_format>
1) Numbered weak spots (scope, AC, stop rules, parity).
2) Improved markdown (+ XML) in fenced blocks.
3) Changelog table: change | why.
4) Ask before applying to target file.
Stop: invalid path; user forbids apply; target already adequate.
</output_format>
```

## Tool-fit notes

| Variant | Best for | Why |
|---------|----------|-----|
| markdown | Copilot (GPT) / Codex / ChatGPT | structured 3-part output + worked example table |
| XML | Claude Code / Claude | «do not execute target» holds across long reads |

## When to use

| After writing… | Meta-improve checks… |
|----------------|----------------------|
| `add-tests.md` | AC vs planted bugs; test-only scope; remainder rule |
| `fix-prod-code.md` | tests-as-spec; minimal diff; any-red-test workflow |
| `review-pr.md` | review-only scope; «≥3 findings» enforceable |
| `*-description.md` | single-source file rule; output path only |

## Verified

- [x] Run against `prompts/debug-failing-test.md`; produced weak spots + improved blocks + changelog
- [x] Did not execute target prompt's task (no `npm test` diagnosis, no edits to `app/`)
